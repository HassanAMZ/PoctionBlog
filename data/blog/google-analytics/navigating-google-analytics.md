## Welcome to a tour of the Account/Property/View switcher in the Google Analytics interface.

### If you have numerous accounts, properties, or views set up,

you can easily switch between them by selecting the pulldown menu in the upper-left corner that contains the title of your View.

You can choose an account, a property, or a view when you open the account picker. You may also do a name search for any of them. Click anywhere on the screen outside of the Account selector to close it.

**Alert icon**

You may get alerts about your Google Analytics properties and views by clicking the bell icon in the upper right corner.

**Alert menu**

This could be data that isn't being collected correctly or a setting that needs to be tweaked. Click anywhere on the screen outside of the notifications to close the Alerts menu.

### Feedback, assistance, and preferences

Two more icons can be seen at the upper right of your Analytics view:

- You can email comments to Google Analytics or look up help articles using the "question mark" icon.
- You can switch between other Google accounts, manage your existing Google account, or sign out using the user symbol.

### Customization

You can generate bespoke reports for your business under the Customization area. Customization will be covered in a later course.

### Navigation on the left-hand side

You'll use the left-hand navigation to move between reports. Each of these parts will reveal the reports that belong to that segment when you click on it.

### Reports in Real-Time

Real-time reports give you insight into real-time user behavior on your website, such as where visitors are coming from and whether they are converting.

### Audience **Reports**

Users' age and gender, where they're from, their interests, how engaged they were, whether they're new or recurring users, and what technology they're using are all shown in audience reports.

### Reports on **Acquisition**

Users came to your site through which channels (such as advertising or marketing initiatives), according to acquisition reports. This could encompass a variety of marketing channels, including:

- "Organic" is a term used to describe a product that is (or unpaid search)
- "CPC" stands for "cost per click" (often known as "paid search").
- "Recommendation" (traffic that comes from another website)
- "Other" or "Social" (from a social network) (a group of low volume traffic sources)

### Reports on Behavior

People's behavior on your site is tracked via behavior reports, which show which pages they visited, as well as their landing and exit pages. You can also track what your users looked for on your site and whether they interacted with specific elements with some further effort.

### Reports on Conversions

Conversion reports allow you to track website goals in relation to your company's goals.

### Admin

All of your Google Analytics options, including user permissions, tracking code, view settings, and filters, are found under the Admin section.

### Left-hand navigation is collapsed.

Use this pointer to make the navigation smaller and give your reports more room.
